     <h1>Uncanny Valley? More like a mountain!</h1>
     <p>Assignment: 
        Post a written assessment to your blog of your thoughts and opinions on The Uncanny Valley (from the two videos we watched today). What is your take on hyperrealism? Do you feel like you identify with protagonists who are human-like or cartoonish? What are your thoughts on how CGI has advanced so much that artists have the ability to create our own realities? What are possible repercussions of CGI looking so realistic that it could be interpreted as reality? What do you feel are the responsibilities of artists who utilize these advanced CGI tools?
    <br><br>
    So, the Uncanny Valley. Is it creepy? Yes. That's the whole point. 
    But, its getting better! Animation and robotics are both getting remarkably close to realistic  human movement and expressions. Now, some people think that this is actually really scary and bad. Of course, in some senses, it is. We already have technology that can generate videos of actual people saying things that they have never said. For exampe, there is a video of Barrack Obama singing a song. Obviously, he never sung that song. Now, the scary part is that they can create videos of people saying very controversial things. 
    
    However, I like to see the silver lining. Right now, there are many people that believe everything on the internet at face value. In the future, because of the realism of animation and AI, nothing can be trusted. The thing is, everybody thinks that we are in danger because their career will be ruined if there is a video  of them saying something racist, generated by AI. But, if those videos are able to be created so easily, nobody will take them at face value. Therefore, people will actually stop blindly believing everything on the internet.
    <br><br>
    Aside from that, I think having hyperrealistic CGI is an amazing advancement, and is huge for animated movies and video games.  Specifically for games, the more realistic a game can look (in many cases), at a good low cost, the more possibilities for immersion there are. And, immersion is key in gaming, especially in RPG's. So with the "ability to create our own realities" in hyper realistic graphics comes the new generation of games that feel so real, they may as well be live action movies you can control. </a>

        <img src="dab.png" style="width: 800px; height: 400px;">
        <p>This is Mavanan Sahshaha. I decided to make the pose a dab because in my opinion, despite the "meme" status of this pose, I think it carries a lot of subtext. You see, Mavanan, from this pose, you can tell is feeling happy and upbeat. I also like this pose because it requires me to move every limb in order to fully express how awesome it is. So it was good practice for using the Maya tools.
            <br><br>
            As for the Autodesk Character Generator, I think it's really good for making rough background characters to quickly fill a scene. In my opinion, it is not robust enough and does not offer enough options to truly be a real character creator from which you could make unique characters. Theoretically, at least to me, the best character creators have the ability to create any character in existence. Even animated ones! However, as for quickly making characters that are different enough from each other, this is top class.
            <br><br>
            First Article:
                I think this article has the right idea, but the wrong opinion. I agree that virtual avatars and the worlds themselves do change the personalities and stuff of us, but in a good way. Usually, the avatars in game are free of consequence, and being able to do and say things without worrying about the effects does change how we act in real life-it makes us more aware of our actual actions. 
                <br><br>
            Second Article:
                This article was really interesting, and made me think of some point that I have already thought about in the past. Not only in video games, but in book and movies as well, people tend to put themseleves in place of the main character. Sometimes thinking, "this is what I would do," or even more dramatically, reading CYOA books so they actually *can* make those decisions. The same goes for games, if you're going to be putting yourself in place of the main character, why not make the main character a reflection of yourself, but enhanced with your best traits? Or in a more fantasy or sci fi setting, something that you wish you could be?

            Gender Accessebility in games, and online in general. Does it matter? Should it?<br>
            Well, after reading the article, I kind of agree and kind of disagree. I do agree that examples such as<br>
            Pokemon, where they ask "Are you a boy or a girl?" to determine the pronouns are out of date. However,<br>
            because of the advanced game making technology we have nowadays, its almost too easy to just have an input<br>
            field at the beginning of your game to enter your desired pronouns. So, while I agree that game makers should<br>
            provide this option to players, the fact that they're not makes me think there is some other reason it's not happening.<br>
            But in any case, there is not a single game in existance where your gender or sex or identity or anything actually matters.<br>
            Playing an avatar in a game is almost an extension of yourself, and games with robust character designer features really show that. <br>
            Other games are not about you, but about a certain character, in which case your desired preference doesn't matter because you're
            playing an already designed character. It's not supposed to be you. And in the examples of Pokemon, your character is only visible as
            a small pixelated thing, in games like that, most of the focus is on the Pokemon and not your own character. <br>
            Basically what I'm saying is that in my opinion, its a much simpler issue than people, and this article, are making it out to be. <br>

           YES, IT'S JANKY! I know! I actually had a lot of trouble animating this, not because of the animation part
           but because of the Maya part. I am actually pretty good at animating, at least I think so, because I have
           lots of experience with 2D Animation. However, 3d animation is something I'm fairly new to, and I really
           did not like the Maya animation feature. For one, the biggest issue I had was constantly changing keyframes for
           certain limbs that I didn't want to! In fact, that's why my arms are so weird looking in the gif. I animated the legs
           first, and after that the arms were supposed to get copy-pasted, but the problem is that it also copy-pasted
           the legs positions! I had no idea what to do to fix that, so I just tried my best to manually transform each
           arm position to each keyfram that I couldn't copy paste.
<br><br>
           However, as a first 3d animation ever (in college), I am satisfied with it. I know that I am only going
           to get better from here on, especially as I get more comfortable with the software. (I used to use the Adobe 
           3D animator).

       <p>
           Now, I don't have WIP pictures because I was working on this in class, and then after the fact I got very caught up
           in my frustration. :(

           Article 1: Personally, I was not too surprised or interested in the content of this article. 
           When talking about someone's virtual avatar, we already know that many people would design their
           avatars to be a more idealized version of themselves. This article  conducts the experiment
           to test that hypothesis, but the findings are exactly what we originally thought. So, it's not that
           interesting in my opinion. However, I will say that one thing I thought was notable was that in the 
           double avatar creation part, they first asked the participants to make their own avatar, and then the 
           no-resitrictions avatar. In this order I believe it skewed the results, because if you're making two
           characters, and one of them is already supposed to look like you, the second one is less likely to look
           like you because you don't want to make two identical avatars. But, other than that, I didn't find This
           much of a read.          
        <br><br>
           Article/Video 2: I don't really have much to say about this video. I disagree with some of it and agree with some
           of it. But I will say that it's a bit of an exhageration, and an issue that is being way blown out of proportion.
           Literally one of the last lines is how these women's fans control them "by dispensing and withholding likes." This 
           is a completely rificulous statement if you think about what it actually means. They're not being controlled by "their fans,"
           but rather their desire for attention and validation. That was really my strongest gripe about the video.

           Video 1: This video was super interesting! I myself am an avid gamer, and find myself, yes, caring about characters in the games.
           I never really thought why, I always just chalked it up to good writing. But after watching the video, it all makes sense now!
           Thinking about games such as "Just Shapes and Beats," Portal 2, and Minecraft, there are so many non-human characters,
           boiling down to even just s a literal square, and yet I genuinely care about what happens to them. And the three aspects
           of a characters attractiveness the video talks about completely make sense. However, the one thing I will counter,
           is that a character can be none of those three, and still be a likeable character. Take Kenny from Telltale's The Walking Dead,
           he is not socially attractive, physically attractive, or usefulness attractive. Yet, just because of the way he is written, as 
           a character that you hate but love and have conflicting feelings about, you can't help but care for him.      
        <br><br>
           Article 2: Uh...this article I didn't totallt get, it seems to just be listing examples of online funerals for people and their 
           avatars? I already knew about this though. Unless I misunderstood the point.

       <img src="AlayFallGif.gif" width="1000px" height="700px">

       For my project, I decided to create and animate my little brother, Alay. 
       For making him in Autodesk Character Generator, I was actually quite surprised at how 
       well he turned out. In all honesty, the hair plus the eyes looking very similar pretty
       much made the whole character. Interesting huh? The mouth is less accurate than I would've
       liked but I spent a while trying to find a combination of mouths that would look good, 
       could't find any. Thats one of the things I don't like about ACG, that you have to adjust
       using presets.

       <img src="WIP1.png" width="1000px" height="700px">

       Next I imported him into Mixamo, because I really, really liked all the different animations
       available there. I scrolled through the sports ones because he plays soccer, volleyball, and 
       badminton. But I found one thats absolutely perfect...the falling! Among other things,
       Alay is literally the most clumsy person ever, he's fallen off of a chair multiple times,
       and even falling while standing still. No idea...

       <img src="WIP2.png" width="1000px" height="700px">

       Finally, I took that into Maya, added some indoor lighting, and then moved it to photoshop,
       where I added a background that is of an empty room, just to highlight that he will
       trip even when theres nothing to trip on. 
       <img src="WIP3.png" width="1000px" height="700px">

       All in all, I think this was pretty fun. The only gripe I have is that my background doesn't exactly
       match my lighting. But I think it's close enough!
